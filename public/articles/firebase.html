            <h2>Organizing pages</h2>
            <p>As it turns out, Firbase doesn't allow displaying of "directory pages", which makes setting up a "blog"
                structure pretty inefficient, as any linking would have to all be done manually, or managed by the
                firestore database. My thought was to use the directory listing pages for blog post navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm overall trying to stay away from dynamic sites here for performance reasons. If
                you're willing to spend money on decent hosting, you can MAKE Wordpress performant. But without
                resources to throw at it, Wordpress is a bloated, laggy, system overloading nightmare of a build tool.
            </p>
            <p>If I decide to go the dynamic thing, I'll probably opt for Ghost. I don't have much of an interest in
                selling anything, and even if I did Ghost has options there too. It's fast, it's easy to work with, it's
                everything Wordpress is not. But for now, my hosting costs for this firebase hosted site are exactly $0
                (sans the domain name, obviously), which is definitely the right price.</p>
