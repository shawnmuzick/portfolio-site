      <h2>Vim Stuff</h2>
      <p>:w other_file</p>
      <p>Use to save the open file with a different file name</p>
      <p>v gg G J</p>
      <p>
        Use to minify the file. Basically: Visual mode, goto top, select to
        bottom, minify
      </p>
      <p>:tabnew newFile.html</p>
      <p>
        Then use gT to cycle between the tabs. Turns out the same keybinds
        made their way to the VS Code plugin, which is much nicer than the
        defaults.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Basically, I'm trying to get myself to use VIM as my main editor,
        rather than the VS Code vim plugin. Most of the functionality can be
        pretty easily replicated, and it's incredibly performant. I've run
        into the issue, though, that copying and pasting text across open VIM
        instances is a problem, specifically with panes/splits. It turns out
        it works fine with tabs. Just:
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned about xTerm 256 colors today and tweaked my VIM theme,
        originally based on oneDark. Some of the yellows and greys were hard
        to see, so I adjusted the colors to make the contrast better.
      </p>
      <h2>Extensions</h2>
      <div id="extensionsList" style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Bracey: use for live-server. It highlights the elements as you navigate too, which is helpful.</p>
        <p>Airline: visual feedback of modes as you switch. </p>
        <p>NerdTree: use for a visual file tree.</p>
        <p>Emmet-Vim: use for emmet shortcuts. It's a bit cumbersome with the default keybindings, but it works</p>
        <p>YouCompleteMe: autocompletion, makes it more competitive with VSCode as an actual workspace. Vim has built in
          ways to do this, but they're less convienent. It is a bit of work to install though.</p>
        <p>Vim-Prettier: has 135 npm security vulnerabilities as of 6-30-21.</p>
